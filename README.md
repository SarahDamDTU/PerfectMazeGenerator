# Analysis and Implementation of Algorithms for Generating Perfect Mazes
Perfect mazes are mazes, which only have one solution. This repository contains implementations of three known algorithms for generating perfect mazes. These are the Recursive Backtracking algorithm, Prim's algorithm and Wilson's algorithm. Furthermore, it contains three algorithms, which are constructed of parts of the three algorithms, which I designed myself. The main focus of my thesis was to develop an algorithm with large values for four chosen properties. These properties are the number of dead ends, the number of rivers, the length of the solution to the maze and the amount of turns on the solution.

The thesis is submitted as a bachelor thesis at the institute DTU Compute at the Technical University of Denmark.

## Folder structure
The project contains many folders.
- 


## Prerequisites and libraries
To run the code it is required to have the following programs and libraries installed:
- Java 12 Runtime Environment
- Python 3.7.2
- Numpy library for Python
- Matlibplot library for Python

## Usage of the program
The program is run by opening the project in the IDE of your choice. Build and run the project and the menu will be displayed.

How to use the menu in detail can be found in the report. But there is a small guide, when pressing the "About" then "Help" in the menu bar. This will display a small pop-up window with details of the different functions in the program.

All tests generate .txt files, which are all put in the tests folder.

## Running the experiments 
All experiments are made in python. The experiment folder can be opened in your IDE for python of choice. All the experiment files generates images, which are saved in the images folder within the experiment folder.
