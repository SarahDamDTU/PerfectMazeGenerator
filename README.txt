# PerfectMazeGenerator
Bachelor project at DTU for DTU Compute. Topic: Perfect Maze Generation.

The program is run by opening the project in the IDE of your choice. Build and run the project and the menu will be displayed.

How to use the menu in detail can be found in the report. But there is a small guide, when pressing the "About" then "Help" in the menu bar. This will display a small pop-up window with details of the different functions in the program.
